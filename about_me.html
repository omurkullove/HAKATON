        As a frontend developer, I've always found it difficult to draw the line
        between what is considered to be frontend and backend development.
        Apparently I'm not alone in this! My first job in a digital agency
        involved me working with HTML, Sass, and Coffeescript to build websites
        that match as closely as possible to the designs provided by the design
        team. In addition to this, I would work with Ruby on Rails, which our
        custom CMS was built on, to pull through data into the views. I had a
        great mentor in that job, who taught me so much about Sass and code
        organisation, which I'm still very passionate about today (I can't thank
        you enough Simon!). As a junior I was thrown in at the deep end, and for
        me it was the best way to learn. In my mind, this was a frontend
        developer's role, and it felt clearly defined at the time.
      </p>
      <h1 class="own__information_title text-danger fw-bold">A New Chapter</h1>
      <p class="own__information_text">
        In 2015, I moved to a different digital agency. The frontend developers
        wrote HTML, Sass, and some JavaScript, and then passed it all on to the
        backend developers to hook up to the CMS. Things have changed a lot
        since then, and now our frontends work with the CMS and C# Razor markup,
        as well as React and Vue when required. But it seems that since frontend
        frameworks have gained more popularity, the definition of what a
        frontend developer actually does has become even more blurry. Other
        people can sometimes struggle to know which tasks are frontend and which
        are backend. Sometimes I feel as though people don't entirely realise
        the amount of work that is involved in frontend development. We're in a
        sort of hybrid role that works between designers and backend developers
        to make sure your website looks awesome and performs well. It also
        becomes difficult when recruiting new frontend developers. As a company,
        we pride ourselves on building websites that match our designs as
        closely as possible. People will literally tell me if an icon is a few
        pixels out. And I know what you're thinking, but that's not a bad thing.
        It has made me better at my job and the smallest changes like that can
        have a massive effect on the final product. Everyone in the company
        knows this. It's a team effort and it's constructive. No one takes it
        personally. Everybody cares deeply about what we're creating. The
        difficulty in recruiting a new frontend is that we need someone who is
        extremely capable with HTML, Sass, styling, and the design side of
        things - but also a great JavaScript developer. And it seems that they
        are more divided than ever these days.
